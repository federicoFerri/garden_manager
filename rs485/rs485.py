    RS485 protocol library - non-blocking.

    Can send from 1 to 255 bytes from one node to another with:
    * Packet start indicator (STX)
    * Each data byte is doubled and inverted to check validity
    * Packet end indicator (ETX)
    * Packet CRC (checksum)

    To allow flexibility you must provide three "callback" functions
    which send or receive data.
    * fWrite is requried to transmit data.
    * fAvailable and fRead are required to received data.

    See SerialWrapper for an example.
